Telegram is a great tool for sharing your newsletter and increasing the list of highly targetted subscribers. Each time you share the post, your telegram subscribers read what you have to say.

These subscribers can be considered as the leads that can be converted to a customer or long term clients.

In this post, we are going to discuss a few ways in which you can increase the number of telegram subscribers.

## Add the subscription widget to your existing newsletter or blog

We at GoWeasel, create a Newsletter page for your telegram bot from where people can discover your telegram bot and see the issues that you have shared before as well.

The issue with the approach is that the discovery of this type of page is very limited unless you start promoting this page.

A better approach is to add a widget to your blog which can allow your subscribers to directly message to your bot from your website itself.

The design of the widget can be anything. We have added a similar widget to our blog as well.

## Adding a great tagline to before the subscription widget

Taglines are very important. Your message should be very loud and clear. What you are offering should be well understood by your subscribers.

An example of the great tagline that we are showing for our [ABP's newsletter page](https://notifier.taskforge.co/avoidboringpeople) is `Interesting tech, investing and you`.

## Adding a reward for subscribing

With GoWeasel you can send a reward for the people to sign up for your newsletter.

For marketing newsletter, a secret recipe for generating leads can be a bonus of signing up for your newsletter.

## Placement of subscribing widget

The placement of subscription widget is very important. For us, we have added the subscription widget in the right sidebar for a desktop device and at the end on a mobile device.

To increase the discovery we have added them in between the posts as well.

You can add a pop-up widget as well to your blog/newsletter or website as well.

## Get testimonials from your telegram subscribers

You can take testimonials from your telegram subscribers and add that to your newsletter page so that new people are inspired to subscribe to your blog.
